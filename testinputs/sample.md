## 25/09/23 12:01, Writing up the Delores release   https://equalitytime.co.uk/2023/09/25/delores/ +EQT
There is now a public delores release at https://github.com/eQualityTime/delores.  It has an entirely squashed git history and is only public. Lots of things where changed so that it could be public and it's much better as a result.  Also learned about JEST and npm a little.   

If I was going to do more work on the release it would be to: 
* Create a bigger make tea version. 

In the future I'll move across features as and when they are worth releasing. 

## 25/09/23 12:09 to 12:24, Now - the choice is delores or another task +EQT
* Did a couple of small urgent things. 
* Next action would be: 
  * Fix the Email from Sarah because that's a blocker 

## 25/09/23 12:24 to 13:03, Searching for funding +EQT
* Nothing - it's very clear that I'd better get two really good bids in. (possibly three)  
* Sending a holding reply to Sarah

## 25/09/23 13:03 to 15:13, Delores properly  +EQT
* I am probably going to need extra food for this meeting. 
* Social media eh? I don't think I have time yet. 
* Process inbox

## 25/09/23 15:13 to 16:06, Accounts +EQT 
Work out what happened with the accounts 
* So what I want is the EQT.html from various times last week. 



Okay so. I think I've worked out what happened. You're going to get a ridiculous amount of detail because I think that's what should happen when someone changes their position about thousands of pounds worth of funding. 

I emailed you at: 16:05 on the 18th. By the time you read the emails the figures were different. 

That spreadsheet reads from this file: https://joereddington.github.io/diary/eqt.html

That file changed at these times: 

266a9ec - Joe Reddington, Tue Sep 19 14:59:00 2023 +0100 : gitignore
721e090 - Joe Reddington, Tue Sep 19 14:58:49 2023 +0100 : Rewriting deploy.sh
d2f826e - joe.reddington@gmail.com, Tue Sep 19 07:20:03 2023 +0100 : Running the deploy script
7832f0c - joe.reddington@gmail.com, Mon Sep 18 16:05:10 2023 +0100 : Running the deploy script
389f578 - joe.reddington@gmail.com, Mon Sep 18 15:38:09 2023 +0100 : Running the deploy script
b960ddd - joe.reddington@gmail.com, Mon Sep 18 15:04:19 2023 +0100 : Running the deploy script
4fd8977 - joe.reddington@gmail.com, Mon Sep 18 14:08:14 2023 +0100 : Running the deploy script
36379cd - joe.reddington@gmail.com, Mon Sep 18 07:38:29 2023 +0100 : Running the deploy script


Now, I spent quite a while on the 18th going through the files and properly tagging time periods so they'd show up as the right time on the spreadsheet. My working hypothesis is that the system took a while to update and I ended up sending you a file based on NOT-entirely-current information.   

To test this I'm going reviewed the changes

389f578 - had about 40 hours of OVF so I went back in time 
b960ddd - had about 28 hours, which is still too much..   
4fd8977 - had about 24 hours, which is at least a bit closer
36379cd - had about 6 hours

That suggests it wasn't an update issue. 

So that's a bust. So I went back to the current sheet and tried to see if there was a way to make 18.33 from all the existing numbers in the pivot table. It turns out there is (there are probably more than one) - but it looks like I started picking out OVF project time and then random switched to White Water Writers time (or the pivot table shifed).  You can see the numbers at the bottom of the ring fence sheet and I copy them here: 

TODO.    


I clearly fixed it very shortly afterwards - but before I did I copied and pasted the table your email you. A combination of several mistakes.
